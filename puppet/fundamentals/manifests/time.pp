# fundamentals::time - keeps master and agents in sync for training
#
# Warning: Do not use in production - this is a hack specifically for
# puppetlabs training courses
#
# Use:
# 1) If an internet connection with port 123 open is available:
# `include fundamentals::time`
# for all nodes, or classify all nodes with the class fundamentals::time
# to ensure:
#   a) The master is in sync with a timeserver from the ntp.org pool, and
#   b) the agents are in sync with the master
#   Since ntpdate is the only reliable way to set time in step (not slew)
#     fashion, we use a cron job to automatically set master's time in sync
#     with a timeserver in the ntp.org pool
#   Agents will use a cron job to sync with the master every 5 minutes
# 2) If an internet connection is not available:
# declare the class thus for all nodes:
# ` class { 'fundamentals::time': offline => 'true' }`
# or classify all nodes using an ENC with the fundamentals::time class
# with the 'offline' parameter set to 'true'. This will:
#   a) ensure that the master's internal clock is the authoritative source
# for time, and
#   b) all agents are synced to the master via a cron task

   # If we are online sync with a timeserver - handy for resuming class
   # allows time to be synced without slew, and without having to restart ntpd
